# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes it easy to build server-rendered applications, static websites, and more.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides a great developer experience with features like:

- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and performance
- Static site generation for blazing-fast websites
- Automatic code splitting for efficient loading
- Built-in CSS and Sass support
- API routes for backend functionality
- Fast refresh for quick iterations

## Setting Up a Project

Creating a new Next.js project is as simple as running:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new project with all the necessary configurations.

## Basic Routing

Next.js has a file-system based router. Files in the `app` directory automatically become routes. For example:

- `app/page.tsx` → `/`
- `app/about/page.tsx` → `/about`
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` → `/blog/:slug`

## Working with Data

Next.js makes it easy to fetch data for your pages. You can use:

1. **Server Components**: Fetch data directly in your components
2. **Route Handlers**: Create API endpoints to fetch data
3. **Static Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its features make it easy to create performant, SEO-friendly websites with a great developer experience.
