# Personal Blog Project Instructions

This is a personal blog built with Next.js and TypeScript. When generating content or code for this project, please follow these guidelines:

## Technology Stack
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new components and files with proper type definitions
- **Next.js**: Follow App Router conventions and use the latest Next.js features and APIs
- **React**: Implement modern React patterns including Server Components when appropriate
- **Testing**: Use React Testing Library for component testing with comprehensive test coverage

## Code Quality Standards
- **Architecture**: Create reusable components that are modular and well-encapsulated
- **Performance**: Optimize for both runtime performance and build-time efficiency
- **Readability**: Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable/function names
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for functions, components, and complex logic
- **Types**: Use precise TypeScript types/interfaces and avoid `any` when possible
- **Linting/Formatting**: Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations for consistent style

## Development Best Practices
- **Accessibility**: Implement WCAG standards with proper aria attributes and semantic HTML
- **SEO**: Add metadata, structured data, and follow Next.js SEO best practices
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and fallback UI components
- **State Management**: Use appropriate state solutions based on complexity (useState, useReducer, Context)
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new components with edge cases covered
- **Git**: Follow conventional commit message format (feat, fix, docs, etc.)

## Content Guidelines
- **Markdown**: Use Markdown for blog posts and ensure proper rendering in the UI
- **Images**: Optimize all images and use Next.js Image component with proper dimensions
- **Design**: Maintain consistent UI/UX aligned with the existing design system
- **Responsive**: Ensure all components work properly across mobile, tablet, and desktop views

When adding new features, ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Next.js, React, and TypeScript.
